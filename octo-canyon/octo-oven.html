    <h1>The Boss of Sector 1: The Octo Oven</h1>

    <img src="images/octo-oven.png" alt text = "Boss #1: Octo Oven" width = "500" height = "500">
    <p>The Octo Oven is the first Boss encountered in Octo Canyon. It is a three-phase boss fight, wherein it will gain new abilities each phase.</p>

    <h2>Phase #1</h2>
    <p>It is generally very simple in phase 1. It has one main attack, which is to push out one loaf of bread. Simply dodge the attack by staying out of the way based on visual cues. 
      
After it does that three times, it will proceed to push out all of the loaves of bread at the player, and the loaves will remain for a longer amount of time. Use this opportunity to shoot ink at the loaves and the white walls of the boss so that you may climb to the top. There, you will find a giant tentacle. Shoot at it until it explodes, and that will end phase 1.</p>

    <h3>Phase #2</h3>
    <p>After phase 2 begins, it will remove some of its climbable white walls and replace it with iron walls, which cannot be inked. It will also shoot out gushers which will damage the player if touched. Simply avoid those gushers. It has generally the same attack patterns as phase 1, however, so one may simply repeat their strategy from phase 1 for phase 2.</p>

    <h4>Phase #3</h4>
    <p>When phase 3 begins, it will now be able to extend a "glazing" machine, which rains down ink on one area and rotates around the arena. The gushers from phase 2 will now also be placed to hinder the player. After the attack, a massive amount of enemy ink will be covering the area. For this, simply outrun the "glazing" machine while avoiding the gushers, and then ink as much of the area as you can. It also still has the bread loaf attack, however it will push them out 4 times instead of 3. The bread loaves will also have some bits of armor on them, unlike phases 1 and 2. Simply dodge the bread loaves just like in phase 1 and 2, and when it does the multi-bread loaf attack, pay attention to where you're shooting your ink and where you jump to so you can climb to the top of the boss once again and finally beat Octo Oven.</p>
