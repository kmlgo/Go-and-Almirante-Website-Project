    <h1>The Boss of Sector 3: Neo Octostomp</h1>

    <img src="/images/octostomp.png" alt text = "Boss #3: Neo Octostomp" width = "500" height = "500">
    <p>The Neo Octostomp is the third Boss encountered in Octo Canyon. Like the other Octobosses in the game, it is a three-phase fight where it will gain new abilities each phase. It is a climbable boss and must be scaled to attack it and progress.</p>
    <p>The Octostomp is fought in a large circular arena, with the outer part of the arena being on lower ground than the inner part.</p>

    <h2>Phase #1</h2>
    <p>In phase 1, it will do a sliding attack where it rushes towards the player, leaving a trail of ink behind it. It will then proceed to do a face plant after it reaches the edge of the arena. After the face plant, it will remain on the ground for some time. It will take a while for the Octostomp to reach you, so simply shoot some ink at your side and get out of the way. </p>

    <p>The Octostomp's walls are inkable, so while it's open and vulnerable after the face plant, take the opportunity to climb up the walls. A tentacle will be visible at the top. Shoot at it enough times, and phase 1 will end.</p>

    <h3>Phase #2</h3>
    <p> In phase 2, alongside keeping the attacks from phase 1, the Octostomp will now gain armor covering its entire body except for its face. On its face will instead be a buckle. The armor cannot be inked, nor can it be broken if you shoot at the armor. While it has the armor, it will be able to shoot at you with a gun on its head. Simply ink the surrounding area with your own ink to swiflty avoid the attack by diving into your ink. </p>

    <p>The buckle mentioned earlier, however, can be shot at. If you shoot at it enough times, the buckle will eventually break and the Octostomp's armor will be removed. After that, use the same strategies from phase 1. If done right, you will then reach phase 3.</p>
    
    <h4>Phase #3</h4>
    <p>In phase 3, alongside its armor regenerating, it will gain two other faces, which will increase the range of its attacks. It will still use the same attacks from the previous phases, as well. </p>
    
    <p>Basically, just employ the same strategies from the previous 2 phases, however maintain a larger distance from the Octostomp. If it's going to do its rushing attack and it still has its two faces and armor, keep rushing in another direction or fall back into the lower part of the arena. </p>

    <p>Breaking the buckle removes both its extra faces and its armor, and it will be just like how it was in phase 1. When its finally open to attack, take your chance to ink its walls, shoot at the tentacle, and you'll finally win against the Neo Octostomp.</p>
