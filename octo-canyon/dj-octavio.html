    <p>DJ Octavio is the fifth and final Boss of Octo Canyon. Contrary to other bosses, it is a four-phase boss fight, rather than three.</p>
    <p>The fight takes place in a large circular arena in a concert venue-like location.</p>

    <h2>Phase #1</h2>
    <p>Phase #1 consists of 4 basic attacks:</p>
    <p>Regular Fists <br>
      DJ Octavio will launch spring-loaded fists at the player. These can be sent back towards him by shooting them for a brief period of time. This attack is the only method of dealing damage to the boss for the whole fight.</p>
    <p>Spinning Fists <br> 
      DJ Octavio will launch spinning spring-loaded fists at the player. This attack is very similar to the previous one, however, these fists cannot be inked or reflected back and must be dodged.</p>
    <p>Splat Bombs <br>
      DJ Octavio will launch 4 large splat bombs in a horizontal row at the player. These can be easily dodged by moving backwards. However, it is possible to fall off the arena, so be sure to be mindful of how much space is left behind you.</p>
    <p>Ink Shower <br>
      DJ Octavio will launch himself at the player, raining down an ink shower. This path of the attack is a straight line that will cover the entire diameter of the arena. As such, the best way to dodge is to either side of the attack.</p>

    <p>After reflecting back 8 fists, DJ Octavio will fall out of the Octobot II. Shoot him and the boss will proceed to phase #2.</p>

    <h3>Phase #2</h3>
    <p>Phase #2 consists of the same basic attacks as phase #1 but with a few additions.</p>
    <p>Raised Fists <br>
      DJ Octavio will fly higher into the air, similarly to his ink shower attack, however, instead of lunging at the player, he launches either version of the fist attacks in the previous phase, with the mechanics of both being identical.</p>
    <p>Suction Bombs <br>
      DJ Octavio will launch large suction bombs at the player, similarly to his splat bomb attack. However, these suction bombs are launched directly at the player instead of in a row, allowing for more freedom of movement for dodging.</p>
    <p>Calamari Bombs <br>
      DJ Octavio will launch a number of large calamari bombs in the player's direction. These bombs will become immovable gushers of ink after a short period of time if not inked and destroyed.</p>
    <p>After reflecting back a certain number of hits, DJ Octavio will fall out of the Octobot II once again and can be shot to initiate phase #3.</p>

    <h4>Phase #3</h4>
    <p>Phase #3 is nearly identical to phase #2, with the only key differences being his faster speed and that he performs a dodge, similar to that of dualie, before launching his fist attacks. <br></br> Similarly to the last two phases, after a certain number of hits, DJ Octavio will fall out of the Octobot II and can be shot to begin the final phase.</p>

    <h5>Phase #4</h5>
    <p>The player will receive a modified rainmaker from Sheldon and continue the fight on a pair of ink rails instead of on the arena.<br></br> DJ Octavio now only has two attacks, his regular and spinning fist attacks. The spinning fists can be dodged by either jumping or moving to the opposite ink rail, while the regular fists can be shot as before.</p>
    <p>After reflecting back 8 fists, The Ocotbot II will fall to the floor of the arena and a third ink rail will appear. Switch to the third ink rail and the player will be led to slam the rainmaker directly onto DJ Octavio, ending the boss fight.</p>
