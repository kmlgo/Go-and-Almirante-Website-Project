    <img class="image" src="/images/dj-octavio.png" alt text="Boss #5: DJ Octavio" width="550" height="500">
    <p class="first">DJ Octavio is the fifth and final Boss of Octo Canyon. Contrary to other bosses, it is a four-phase boss fight,
      rather than three.</p>
    <p class="first">The fight takes place in a large circular arena in a concert venue-like location.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase #1</h2>
    <p>Phase #1 consists of 4 basic attacks:</p>
    <p class="header">Regular Fists </p>
    <p class="paragraph">DJ Octavio will launch spring-loaded fists at the player. These can be sent back towards him by shooting them for
      a brief period of time. This attack is the only method of dealing damage to the boss for the whole fight.</p>
    <p class="header">Spinning Fists </p>
    <p class="paragraph">DJ Octavio will launch spinning spring-loaded fists at the player. This attack is very similar to the previous
      one, however, these fists cannot be inked or reflected back and must be dodged.</p>
    <p class="header">Splat Bombs </p>
    <p class="paragraph">DJ Octavio will launch 4 large splat bombs in a horizontal row at the player. These can be easily dodged by moving
      backwards. However, it is possible to fall off the arena, so be sure to be mindful of how much space is left
      behind you.</p>
    <p class="header">Ink Shower </p>
    <p class="paragraph">DJ Octavio will launch himself at the player, raining down an ink shower. This path of the attack is a straight
      line that will cover the entire diameter of the arena. As such, the best way to dodge is to either side of the
      attack.</p>

    <p >After reflecting back 8 fists, DJ Octavio will fall out of the Octobot II. Shoot him and the boss will proceed to
      phase #2.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Phase #2</h3>
    <p>Phase #2 consists of the same basic attacks as phase #1 but with a few additions.</p>
    <p class="header">Raised Fists </p>
    <p class="paragraph">DJ Octavio will fly higher into the air, similarly to his ink shower attack, however, instead of lunging at the
      player, he launches either version of the fist attacks in the previous phase, with the mechanics of both being
      identical.</p>
    <p class="header">Suction Bombs </p>
    <p class="paragraph">DJ Octavio will launch large suction bombs at the player, similarly to his splat bomb attack. However, these
      suction bombs are launched directly at the player instead of in a row, allowing for more freedom of movement for
      dodging.</p>
    <p class="header">Calamari Bombs </p>
    <p class="paragraph">DJ Octavio will launch a number of large calamari bombs in the player's direction. These bombs will become
      immovable gushers of ink after a short period of time if not inked and destroyed.</p>
    <p>After reflecting back a certain number of hits, DJ Octavio will fall out of the Octobot II once again and can be
      shot to initiate phase #3.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Phase #3</h4>
    <p>Phase #3 is nearly identical to phase #2, with the only key differences being his faster speed and that he
      performs a dodge, similar to that of dualie, before launching his fist attacks. <br></br> Similarly to the last
      two phases, after a certain number of hits, DJ Octavio will fall out of the Octobot II and can be shot to begin
      the final phase.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Phase #4</h5>
    <p>The player will receive a modified rainmaker from Sheldon and continue the fight on a pair of ink rails instead
      of on the arena.<br></br> DJ Octavio now only has two attacks, his regular and spinning fist attacks. The spinning
      fists can be dodged by either jumping or moving to the opposite ink rail, while the regular fists can be shot as
      before.</p>
    <p>After reflecting back 8 fists, The Ocotbot II will fall to the floor of the arena and a third ink rail will
      appear. Switch to the third ink rail and the player will be led to slam the rainmaker directly onto DJ Octavio,
      ending the boss fight.</p>
