    <h1 class="center">The Boss of Sector 4: Octo Shower</h1>

    <img class="image" src="/images/octo-shower.png" alt text="Boss #4: Octo Shower" width="500" height="500">
    <p class="first">The Octo Shower is the second to the last boss of the Hero Mode of Splatoon 2. Similar to the rest
      of the bosses, it is a three-phase boss fight where it gains new abilities each phase. You cannot shoot at it,
      however you can shoot at the octocopters which are carrying it, which will be required to progress through the
      fight. </p>
    <p class="first">The arena it is fought in is a circular arena with many towers which you can ink to allow you to
      gain a higher vantage point. </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase #1</h2>
    <p>In phase 1, it is carried by three octocopters and already has quite a few attacks.</p>
    <p>It will bring out a sniper-like weapon, and will charge up an attack before releasing a deadly shot towards the
      player. Simply hide behind one of the many towers or be fast enough to dodge it. It will release a shower-like
      stream of ink underneath itself which can instantly splat the player if the player was directly underneath it.
      This attack only occurs if the player's underneath it, so just avoid staying under it. It can fire a torpedo-like
      weapon which follows the player. The player can simply hide behind a tower to avoid it, or shoot at it to destroy
      it. The boss will signal the octocopters carrying it to shoot ink at the player. These are easily avoidable as
      they are slow single shots. </p>

    <p>To attack the octocopters carrying it, try to reach a high vantage point. Aim well enough, and you'll hit the
      octocopters and bring the octoshower down. When it's down, a tentacle will appear. Shoot at it enough times to
      destroy it, and phase 2 will begin afterwards.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Phase #2</h3>
    <p>In phase 2, it will now have 4 octocopters carrying it. It will also gain one new attack, and modify the shower
      attack. In its new attack, it will gain a hand-crank cannon that is like a splatling. Take cover behind a tower to
      avoid it. Meanwhile, for the shower attack, it can now move while doing it, and will usually use it after one of
      its octocopters have been splatted. It will charge in a straight path towards the player. Ink to your side and
      make a path of escape that you can swim in to avoid the shower.</p>

    <p>For everything else, maintain the same strategy as phase 1. Eventually, you'll splat all the octocopters and down
      the Octoshower and be able to begin phase 3.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Phase #3</h4>
    <p>In phase 4, it is now being carried by deluxe octocopters, which are able to quickly dodge left and right. In
      that regard, try to increase your rate of attack as precise shots will be more difficult to pull off now.</p>

    <p>It also gains one new attack, which is a Sting Ray. This Sting Ray can go through the walls of the towers, which
      means the you must dodge it by being quick and inking your surroundings so you have better mobility. Overall,
      however, it keeps the exact same attacks as the previous phases. If you maintain the same strategies as the
      previous phases and be careful, you'll eventually defeat it.</p>
