      <h1>The Boss of Sector 2: The Octo Samurai</h1>
  
      <img class="image" src="/images/octo-samurai.png" alt text = "Boss #2: Octo Samurai" width = "500" height = "500">
      <p>The Octo Samurai is the second Boss encountered in Octo Canyon. Similarly to the Octo Oven, it is a three-phase boss fight, wherein it gains new abilities each phase. It wields a giant roller and can be attacked directly.</p>
      <p>The arena you face it in is a circular arena, with some parts having walls and other parts having no walls.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Phase #1</h2>
      <p>In phase 1, it will begin its assault by trying to hit you with its large roller, similar to how the player uses the roller weapon. Be quick and take advantage of the time the attack animation takes to finish so that you can dodge.</p>
    <p>Its other attack in phase 1 is to ride its weapon like a motorcycle towards you, leaving a large trail of enemy ink behind it in the process. Similarly to the previous attack, just be quick and dodge before the roller hits you. Take advantage of the space you have and ink your surroundings so you have quick escape routes. </p>
      <p>Use all chances you have to attack the samurai and be very aggressive, and eventually it'll be splatted. When it's splatted, the roller-motorcycle it has will flip over and reveal a tentacle, just like other Octobosses. Hit that tentacle enough times, and you'll initiate phase 2.</p>

      <h3>Phase #2</h3>
      <p>In phase 2, it will keep its attacks from the first phase and gain 2 new attacks. One is that it will jump towards the player and do a vertical swing with its roller. Use the time it spends in the air and use whatever escape route you have and move out of the way.</p>
      <p>Its other is a quick spin attack using its roller. That attack is indicated by a high-pitched sound playing along with its eyes glowing. Try to keep as much distance away from it as possible when you notice the attack indicators. For everything else, maintain the same strategies that you used in phase 1. If done well enough, you'll eventually reach phase 3.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Phase #3</h4>
      <p>In phase 3, it gains one new attack. This one new attack has the Octo Samurai do three vertical swings of the roller, which will shoot out enemy ink in a straight line. This attack has extremely high range, and can reach the opposite end of the arena. This attack is still a bit narrow, so as long as you have space or an escape route, you'll be able to dodge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Meanwhile, for the rest of its attacks, they become much more aggressive. Listed below are the changes to the attacks: </p>
      
  <p>Its charge attack now aims directly at you, though there's still a brief pause after the attack.It will also attack three times in a row when doing its regular swings. Three vertical swings will also always follow after it does a jump attack, though those swings lack the same range as a regular vertical swing. Lastly, it will now do its motorcycle charge twice, one immediately after it finishes the first one. </p>
      
  <p>Maintain the same strategies you had from the last 2 phases, and just be sure to pay more attention to your surroundings and be careful. Keep it up, and you'll finally beat the boss. </p>
